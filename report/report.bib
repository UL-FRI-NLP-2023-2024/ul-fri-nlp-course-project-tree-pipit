@misc{hu2021lowrank,
  abstract = {An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale
pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or
domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all
model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example --
deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B
parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or
LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank
decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly
reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to
GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable
parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA
performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa,
DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher
training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We
also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model
adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package
that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our
implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at
https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.},
